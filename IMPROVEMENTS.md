# =� Poly-Maker Improvements & New Features

## Overview

This document describes all the major improvements made to the Polymarket market maker bot. These enhancements address order churn, reward optimization, automated market selection, monitoring, and provide a web dashboard for easy management.

##  Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Reduced Order Cancellation Churn** �

**Problem:** Orders were being cancelled and recreated too frequently on every small price change, wasting gas fees and missing fills.

**Solution:**
- **Rate Limiting**: Added 30-second cooldown between trading actions on price changes (`data_processing.py:108-119`)
- **Wider Tolerances**: Increased price diff threshold from 0.5� � 1.5� and size threshold from 10% � 25% (`trading.py:44-47`, `trading.py:129-133`)

**Files Modified:**
- `poly_data/global_state.py` - Added `last_trade_action_time` tracking
- `poly_data/data_processing.py` - Implemented rate limiting logic
- `trading.py` - Increased cancellation thresholds

**Result:** Significantly reduced unnecessary order cancellations while still maintaining competitive pricing.

---

### 2. **Reward-Optimized Pricing** =�

**Problem:** Orders weren't explicitly optimized for Polymarket's maker reward formula.

**Solution:**
- Implemented `get_reward_optimized_price()` function that calculates optimal price placement based on Polymarket's reward formula: `S = ((v - s) / v)^2`
- Blends reward-optimized pricing with competitive market-making
- Places orders at ~40% of max_spread distance from mid-price for optimal reward/fill balance

**Files Modified:**
- `poly_data/trading_utils.py:124-215` - Added reward optimization functions

**Formula Used:**
```python
v = max_spread / 100  # Max spread in decimal
optimal_distance = v * 0.4  # 40% of max spread
bid_price = mid_price - optimal_distance
ask_price = mid_price + optimal_distance
```

**Result:** Orders now placed at prices that maximize maker rewards while maintaining fill probability.

---

### 3. **Automated Market Selection** <�

**Problem:** Markets had to be manually selected in Google Sheets, which was time-consuming and subjective.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced `select_markets.py` with composite scoring algorithm
- Automatically ranks markets based on weighted criteria:
  - **Reward** (default 50%): Higher maker rewards
  - **Spread** (default 30%): Tighter spreads = more competitive
  - **Volatility** (default 20%): Lower volatility = less risky
- Adds price proximity bonuses for markets near 0.15-0.85 range
- Flexible filtering by minimum reward and maximum volatility

**Usage:**
```bash
# Select top 10 markets with composite scoring
python select_markets.py --top 10 --min-reward 0.75 --max-volatility 20

# Custom weights (must sum to 1.0)
python select_markets.py --top 5 --reward-weight 0.6 --spread-weight 0.3 --volatility-weight 0.1

# Simple mode (reward only, no composite scoring)
python select_markets.py --top 5 --simple

# Preview without changing (dry run)
python select_markets.py --top 10 --dry-run

# View market statistics
python select_markets.py --stats
```

**Files Modified:**
- `select_markets.py:21-121` - Added composite scoring functions

**Result:** Markets are now selected automatically based on data-driven metrics, not manual judgment.

---

### 4. **Maker Reward Tracking** =�

**Problem:** No visibility into estimated maker rewards being earned.

**Solution:**
- Created `poly_data/reward_tracker.py` module
- Logs order snapshots every 5 minutes to "Maker Rewards" Google Sheets tab
- Estimates hourly/daily rewards based on order placement and Polymarket's formula
- Tracks position sizes, order prices, and distance from mid-price

**Integration:**
- Automatically called in `trading.py:546-550` after each trading action
- Data logged to Google Sheets for analysis

**Columns Logged:**
- Timestamp, Market, Token, Side (BUY/SELL)
- Open Orders, Order Price, Mid Price, Distance from Mid
- Position Size, Est. Hourly Reward, Daily Rate, Max Spread, Status

**Result:** Real-time visibility into estimated maker rewards for each market.

---

### 5. **Streamlit Web Dashboard** =�

**Problem:** No easy way to monitor bot status, select markets, or view performance without SSHing into server.

**Solution:**
- Built comprehensive Streamlit dashboard (`dashboard.py`)
- 6 main pages:
  1. **Overview** - Key metrics, selected markets, top opportunities chart
  2. **Market Selection** - Interactive market selector with sliders for criteria
  3. **Positions & Orders** - View current positions and recent trades
  4. **Maker Rewards** - Cumulative reward estimates by market
  5. **Trade Log** - Searchable trade history with filters
  6. **Settings** - Bot control, system info, cache management

**Features:**
- Start/stop bot directly from UI
- Auto-refresh every 60 seconds (optional)
- Interactive charts with Plotly
- Filters for trade history
- System resource monitoring

**Usage:**
```bash
# Install dependencies first
pip install streamlit plotly psutil

# Run dashboard
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

**Access:** Opens in browser at `http://localhost:8501`

**Result:** User-friendly web interface for managing the entire bot.

 �

**Problem:** Data updates and market selection had to be run manually.

**Solution:**
- Created `scheduler.py` to orchestrate the complete workflow
- Automatically runs:
  1. `data_updater.py` � fetches latest market data
  2. `select_markets.py` � auto-selects best markets
  3. Optional bot monitoring with alerts

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run full pipeline every hour with auto-selection
python scheduler.py --update-interval 3600 --auto-select --num-markets 5

# Custom parameters
python scheduler.py \
  --update-interval 7200 \
  --num-markets 10 \
  --min-reward 1.0 \
  --max-volatility 15 \
  --auto-select

# With Discord notifications
python scheduler.py --auto-select --webhook-url "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."

# Monitor bot status (alerts if it crashes)
python scheduler.py --auto-select --monitor-bot

# Run once and exit (no loop)
python scheduler.py --auto-select --run-once
```

**Features:**
- Graceful shutdown on Ctrl+C
- Comprehensive logging to `scheduler.log`
- Webhook notifications (Discord, Slack)
- Bot health monitoring

**Result:** Fully automated "set it and forget it" workflow.

## =' Troubleshooting

### Orders Still Cancelling Too Often
- Increase cooldown in `data_processing.py:114` (default 30s)
- Increase thresholds in `trading.py:45-46`

### No Rewards Showing in Dashboard
- Ensure bot has been running for at least 5 minutes
- Check `Maker Rewards` tab exists in Google Sheets
- Verify `poly_data/reward_tracker.py` is being called

### Market Selection Not Working
- Run `python update_markets.py` first to populate data
- Check "Volatility Markets" tab has data
- Try lowering `--min-reward` threshold

### Dashboard Won't Start
- Install dependencies: `pip install streamlit plotly psutil`
- Check port 8501 isn't already in use
- Try `streamlit run dashboard.py --server.port 8502`
